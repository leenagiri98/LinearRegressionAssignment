# Project Name : Multiple Linear Regression Model

> Outline a brief description of your project.
This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.




## General Information
- We want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how 
exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's 
expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 


-we are using  Bike Sharing dataset.
